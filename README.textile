h1. Headword

Rails user name routes for vain users.

h2. Installation

Headword is a Rails engine. It works with versions of Rails greater than 2.3.

In config/environment.rb:

<pre>
config.gem "jeffrafter-headword",
  :lib     => 'headword',
  :source  => 'http://gems.github.com'
</pre>

We recommend you don't vendor the gem:

Make sure the development database exists and run the generator:

<pre>
script/generate headword
</pre>

A number of files will be created and instructions will be printed.

You may already have some of these files. Don't worry. You'll be asked if you want to overwrite them.

Run the migration:

<pre>
rake db:migrate
</pre>

h2. Routes

Headword installs a default catch-all route for single words (e.g., /jeffrafter). These are given the lowest priority in your application. If your application is already catching these routes then you may not be able to access your headword based user pages.

h2. Authors

Headword is based on Spreadhead.

The engine implementation and gem was patterned after the Clearance gem by Thoughtbot.

h2. Suggestions, Bugs, Refactoring?

Fork away and create a "Github Issue":http://github.com/jeffrafter/headword/issues. Please send pull requests.

When you do: 

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
